ActiveMessaging

== DESCRIPTION:

ActiveMessaging is an attempt to bring the simplicity and elegance of rails
development to the world of messaging. Messaging, (or event-driven architecture)
is widely used for enterprise integration, with frameworks such as Java's JMS,
and products such as ActiveMQ, Tibco, IBM MQSeries, etc.

ActiveMessaging is a generic framework to ease using messaging, but is not tied
to any particular messaging system - in fact, it now has support for Stomp, JMS
(using StompConnect or direct on JRuby), WebSphere MQ, Amazon Simple Queue 
Service (SQS), and the all Ruby ReliableMessaging.
